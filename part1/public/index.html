üêæ Welcome to Dog Walking Service ‚Äì Where Your Dog‚Äôs Wellbeing Comes First

At Dog Walking Service, we believe that a happy dog is a healthy dog‚Äîand that starts with regular, enjoyable, and safe walks tailored to your dog‚Äôs individual needs. Whether you‚Äôre a busy pet parent juggling work and life responsibilities, recovering from an injury, or simply seeking a trustworthy companion for your furry friend, we‚Äôre here to help.

Dog Walking Service connects dog owners with experienced, passionate, and verified local dog walkers who treat every pup as their own. Our mission is to make high-quality, personalised pet care both accessible and reliable‚Äîensuring that your dog gets the exercise, attention, and mental stimulation they deserve while you enjoy complete peace of mind.

‚∏ª

üå≥ Why Choose Us?
	‚Ä¢	Experienced & Vetted Walkers
Our walkers are not just dog lovers‚Äîthey are trained and background-checked professionals who understand canine behaviour, leash safety, and route planning. Many of our walkers have backgrounds in pet care, veterinary studies, or dog training.
	‚Ä¢	Tailored Walks for All Breeds and Needs
From energetic huskies who need a morning run to senior Labradors who prefer a leisurely stroll, we customise each walk based on breed, age, energy level, and special requirements. Our flexible options include solo walks, group walks, or adventure walks through parks and trails.
	‚Ä¢	Real-Time Updates and GPS Tracking
Stay connected to your pup‚Äôs walk even when you‚Äôre away. With GPS tracking, live notifications, and photo updates, you can follow your dog‚Äôs route, see where they stopped to sniff, and receive summaries of their walk.
	‚Ä¢	Easy Online Booking & Payment
Schedule walks through our user-friendly website or mobile app. Whether it‚Äôs a one-off walk or a weekly routine, managing bookings and payments is simple, secure, and transparent.
	‚Ä¢	Rain or Shine Reliability
Dogs need exercise every day‚Äîno matter the weather. Our walkers come prepared for sunshine, drizzle, or chilly mornings. You can count on us to show up and give your pup the outing they‚Äôve been waiting for.

‚∏ª

üê∂ Who Is This For?
	‚Ä¢	Working professionals who are away from home during the day and want their dog to get exercise and bathroom breaks.
	‚Ä¢	Older adults or people with limited mobility who want to ensure their dog still gets fresh air and movement.
